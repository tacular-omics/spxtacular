"""Content hashes with a stat-keyed cache, for the checks that run constantly.

WHY THIS EXISTS. `just verify` re-hashes every declared input and every pinned
file on every run. On the scaffold that is a CSV and costs nothing; on a real
project a declared input can be a multi-gigabyte HDF5, and hashing it on every
verify makes the constant gate cost seconds to minutes -- the same
scale-blindness the 3.2.0 re-derivation flaw had, one layer down.

THE CACHE IS A SHORTCUT, NOT AN AUTHORITY. A file's (size, mtime_ns) is the
KEY; the sha256 is still the recorded truth everywhere. Any change to either
stat re-hashes the content, so the only way to a stale answer is content that
changed while size and nanosecond mtime both stayed identical -- which no edit,
copy, checkout or download does. This is the trick every build system uses, and
it does not contradict "hashes, not dates": dates here only decide when to
recompute the hash, never stand in for it.

The cache file is local build state, like .build-stamp: gitignored, safe to
delete at any time (the next run just re-hashes everything), and never a
substitute for the hashes recorded in stats.json / assets.json.

Recording paths (`just pin`, the generators) deliberately do NOT use this:
they run rarely, and the moment a hash becomes the recorded truth it should be
computed from the bytes, not looked up.
